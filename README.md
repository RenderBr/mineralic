# Mineralic
An in-development game made by a few students in middle school. The game is being made with Unity, it is written in the programming language known as C#. The game is a Terraria clone promising a new experience and what we think Terraria should be in our eyes.

Honestly, I'm not sure what to write here but the game's ETA is a few years. We're a small team with 3 people. One working on coding (me), one person working on sprites, and the other working on sounds.

Please don't say this is your work. If your going to build off of this, atleast give credit.

# Wasn't this on a wiki?
Yes, that was the concept. Now we're actually making the game, we will barely be following the concept as the concept is abandoned, we have new ideas!

# What are you planning on adding to the game?
I have a lot I want to add to the game, I am a project manager, but the other two project managers need to agree on these ideas. Here is a list of things we all agreed on adding!

1. Skeleton Mob
2. Caves
3. Levelling System
4. New Sprites
5. Armor 
6. Bosses
7. A lot more coming!
