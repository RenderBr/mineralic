An in-development game made by a few students in middle school. The game is being made with Unity, it is written in the programming language known as C#. The game is a Terraria clone promising a new experience and what we think Terraria should be in our eyes.

Honestly, I'm not sure what to write here but the game's ETA is a few years. We're a small team with 3 people. One working on coding (me), one person working on sprites, and the other working on sounds.

Please don't say this is your work. If your going to build off of this, atleast give credit.
